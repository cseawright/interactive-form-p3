# interactive-form-p3

//Project includes jQuery and utilizes it in at least some aspect of the form.
//On page load, the cursor appears in the "Name" field, ready for a user to type.
//"Your job role" text field appears when user selects "Other" from the Job Role menu.

//Until a theme is selected from the “Design” menu, no color options appear in the “Color” 
drop down and the “Color” field reads “Please select a T-shirt theme”.

//When a new theme is selected from the "Design" menu, the "Color" field and drop down menu 
is updated.

//User cannot select two activities that are at the same time.
//Total cost of selected activities is calculated and displayed below the list of activities.

//The "Credit Card" payment option is selected by default.
//Payment option in the select menu matches the payment option displayed on the page.
//When a user chooses a payment option, the chosen payment section is revealed and the 
other payment sections are hidden.

//Form cannot be submitted (the page does not refresh when the submit button is clicked) until the following requirements have been met:
//Name field isn’t blank.
//Email field contains validly formatted e-mail address: (doesn’t have to check that it's a real e-mail address, just that it's formatted 
like one: sample@address.com, for example).
//At least one checkbox under "Register for Activities" section must be selected.
//If "Credit Card" is the selected payment option, the three fields accept only numbers: a 13 to 16-digit credit card number, a 5-digit zip code, and 3-number CVV value.

//On submission, the form provides an error indication or message for each field that requires validation:
//Name field
//Email field
//“Register for Activities” checkboxes
//Credit Card number, Zip code, and CVV, only if the credit card payment method is selected.

//When JavaScript is disabled, all form fields and payment information is displayed, including the 
"Other" field under the "Job Role" section.
